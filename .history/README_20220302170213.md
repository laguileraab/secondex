There are two distinct formats mixed in the same file 
Format details 
- Each line starts with F or D. 
● If F, this is a "format" line and two formats can be provided (F1 or F2) ● If D, this is a "data" line whose format is defined by the closest above format line. ● If "F1" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with a comma: 
-1. D defining a data line 
-2. Name and surname 
-3. City 
-4. ID formatted as "12345678Z" 

● If "F2" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with space-semicolon-space: 
-1. D defining a data line 
-2. Name and surname 
-3. City 
-4. ID formatted as "12345678-Z"
