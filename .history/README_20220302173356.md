<p align="center"> This is a project for reading a public leak file that is necessary to process to be able to ingest that information into a system. The program consume a text file and return output to STDOUT. The input file represents a list of places and people at different times.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

There are two distinct formats mixed in the same file

Format details:

Each line starts with F or D.
  - If F, this is a "format" line and two formats can be provided (F1 or F2) 
  - If D, this is a "data" line whose format is defined by the closest above format line. 
  - If "F1" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with a comma:
  
  1. D defining a data line

  2. Name and surname

  3. City

  4. ID formatted as "12345678Z"


- If "F2" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with space-semicolon-space:

1. D defining a data line

2. Name and surname

3. City

4. ID formatted as "12345678-Z"

### Prerequisites

Is necessary to have installed Java >= 17 and Maven

[Java](https://www.java.com)
```bash
java --version
```

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
```bash
mvn --version
```

### Installing

The next steps are for generating Jar file inside the folder of the projects where is pom.xml file.

First we clean mvn for old target classes
```bash
mvn clean
```

And then make the package .jar

```bash
mvn package
```

And everything is ready.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

This project was made with Java and BDD, I use [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin) with [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io)

### We need a feature file

Gherkin is written using a feature file and can be written in almost any natural language like English, Spanish, French, etc.

```bash
Feature: Java Code Test


  @Public_leak_file
  Scenario Outline: This scenario will test for correct format in a text file
    Given this "input" with an extension ".txt" in the path "C:/"
    When found "<format>"
    Then divider is "<separator>"
    And ID format must be like "<IDF>"

    Examples:
      | format | separator | IDF |
      | f1     |  ,        | [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][A-Z] |
      | f2     |  ;        | [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[A-Z] |

```

### Perform test scenarios

We can run this test with Gradle , Ant, etc but we use maven in this case like below.

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The system can take 3 parameters.

-Input file, necessary only the first time, then we keep track of the Folder Path with a Temp file. 

-Filter, this can be the City, Name or Id, if not set there's no output.

-


```bash
mvn clean test
```
